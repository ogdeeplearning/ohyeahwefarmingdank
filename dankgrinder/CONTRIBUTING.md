## Report a bug or fix an existing one
### Reporting a bug
If you found a bug, we would greatly appreciate if you could take the time to fill out a [bug report issue](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=). Make sure to include as much relevant information as possible. This will aid us in reproducing the bug and finding its cause. 
### Submitting a bug fix pull request
Pull requests which fix a bug are always welcomed warm-heartedly. Please include an explanation of the problem and how it was solved.

## Implement a new feature or modify an existing one
### Suggesting a feature or modification
We are open to any suggestions. To suggest a feature or modification you can either [creating a suggestion issue](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=suggestion&template=suggestion.md&title=) or asking it in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/Fjzpq8YPSn).
### Getting approval for the implementation or modification of a feature
If you have an idea for a feature and want to open a pull request to implement it, we require you to open a [feature approval request issue](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature-approval-request.md&title=). This is necessary to ensure that your feature or modification aligns with our visions, and you don't waste your precious time on something which won't be approved.
### Submitting a feature pull request
When your feature is ready, before you make a pull request ensure you have:
* Tested everything works as intended
* Commented where necessary
* Conformed to what was approved in the initial request
* Created a feature branch (i.e. `feature/yourfeaturename`) for your feature

## Cosmetics and comments
### Refactoring and code cosmetics
Occasionally, pull requests solely dedicated to refactoring code may be accepted. However, generally we are hesitant to accept such requests because of unintentional implications on the application. It requires careful review to make sure everything still works as intended.
### Editing or adding comments
If you found comments which are vague or don't conform with [Go's code documentation guidelines](https://blog.golang.org/godoc) feel free to create a pull request which changes the comments.
## Questions about source code or contributing
If you have any questions about the source code, how to contribute or anything else related to the application, you may [create a question issue](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md&title=). Alternatively, you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Fjzpq8YPSn) and ask your question there.
